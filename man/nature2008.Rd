\title{The qPCR data from McMurray \emph{et al.} Nature 2008.}
\description{A study of the effect of p53 and/or Ras mutations on gene
  expression. The third dataset is a comparison between four cell types
  -- YAMC cells, mutant-p53 YAMC cells, activated-Ras YAMC cells, and
  p53/Ras double mutant YAMC cells. Three replicates were performed for
  the untransformed YAMC cells, and four replicates were performed for
  each of the other cell types.}
