\title{The qPCR data from Almudevar \emph{et al.} SAGMB 2011.}
\description{Cells transformed to malignancy by mutant p53 and activated
  Ras are perturbed with the aim of restoring gene expression to levels
  found in non-transformed parental cells via retrovirus-mediated
  re-expression of corresponding cDNAs or shRNA-dependent stable
  knock-down. The data contain 4-6 replicates for each perturbation, and
  each perturbation has a corresponding control sample in which only the
  vector has been added.}
